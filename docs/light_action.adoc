== Introduction

Light state action is to control the lights. Definition of the light state are found here https://www.asam.net/static_downloads/ASAM_OpenSCENARIO_V1.2.0_Model_Documentation/modelDocumentation/content/LightState.html[here].

=== Phrasing
Below image explains about the light state phrasing especially where ever light state action is ignored and how base rbg is prioritized.

=== Useful information
Some of useful information about light state action are:

. Light visualization can be toggled by pressing L.
. Light visualization will be only ON from start of simulation when scenario has light state action.
. Model without light material will support light state action.
. Model without light material wont support light state visualization.
. Light material shall be updated in the model but material name cannot be changed.
. Lights in the model shall be remodeled but light name cannot be changed.
. To see light status in scv file. use --extended tag while converting dat to csv.
. Values in csv files #ffffff-ff Percentage which denote #RGB-Emission, Which is in HEX format.
